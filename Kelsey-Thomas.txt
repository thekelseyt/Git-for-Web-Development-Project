    19. What is the difference between a class and an id? - Give me an example of when I might use each one
    Class can be used on any element multiple times on a page while ID can only be used once. Use class to describe various text blocks on a page you want to turn red - for example, any text such as <p class id="warning"> OR <h2 class id="warning"> - CSS could format all warning text, despite their element, to red text. Use ID to identify groups of items such as in a div - for example, <div id="about-me"> would create a division between the "about me" section on the page and the rest of the content - the div id could then be used in CSS to define styles specific to content within that div.

    Step 3: Add your TL as a collaborator on the newly forked repo
    Step 4: Clone the repo by copy/pasting the URL from the green Code button
    Step 5: Open Terminal/command line and navigate to the correct directory to clone the repo to using cd commands
    Step 5: Use the git clone <paste url> command to clone the repo locally to the designated directory

    Step 10: Commit changes by using the git commit -m "enter message about the commit" command

    Step 12: Check GitHub to make sure committed changes were pushed back with the correct branch - make sure you're on your forked copy and not original
    Step 13: Click your branch name and click New Pull Request to create a pull request
    Step 14: On pull request screen, make sure to change the Base Repository to your forked repo
